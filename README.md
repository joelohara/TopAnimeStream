Hello Everyone! 

I am inviting you to join our FREE training and workshop on September 16, 2015 at Riveside Los Angeles, CA. 
Joel Ohara is presenting an informative and entertaining slideshow on his experiences opening a branch office overseas. This is all about Social Marketing Techniques and Local Networking Tips.

We hope you will join us for an evening of great food and good fun to celebrate both the season and a banner business year. There will be lots of wassail and eggnog, and a few surprises as well.
